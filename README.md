## 🎯 Key Capabilities & Core Modules

### 1. ⚖️ Court-Ready Chain of Custody & Security
*   **SHA-256 Custody Ledger**: Every investigator interaction, evidence upload, and report creation is sealed in an immutable hash-linked database.
*   **Log Integrity Verification**: Dynamic verification checksum validation checks ledger states instantly to flag any tampering attempts.
*   **Emergency Lockdown Shield**: Allows investigators to instantly freeze session keys, clear cached memory pools, and lock portal gateways during physical or network intrusion events.

### 2. 🔗 Advanced Blockchain Analytics Engine
*   **Multi-Input Co-Spending Heuristics**: Automatically groups clusters of related wallets to identify corporate entities or illicit owners.
*   **Bridge & Mixer Tracking**: Integrates peeling-chain analysis and mixer detection for Tornado Cash, cross-chain bridge routers (Arbitrum, Polygon, BSC), and swap protocols.
*   **Low-Latency RPC Manager**: Load-balanced JSON-RPC provider pool with real-time health checks, cache registries, and automated failover selectors.

### 3. 🚨 Cyber Threat Intelligence & Correlation
*   **STIX 2.1 & TAXII 2.1**: Downloads and compiles structured STIX feeds to cross-reference addresses against globally recognized threat groups.
*   **Sigma & YARA Rule Engines**: Matches syslog streams and files against Sigma rules for system detection, and compiles YARA signatures for malicious scripts.
*   **Reconstructed Attack Chains**: Maps system alerts and network scans directly into a chronological MITRE ATT&CK kill-chain timeline.

### 4. 📊 Centralized SIEM Monitoring Console
*   **OTel & Elasticsearch Pipelines**: Ingests JSON log records directly to Logstash, indexes them in Elasticsearch, and provides real-time audit visualization via Kibana templates.
*   **Z-Score Anomaly Engine**: Performs latency and rate benchmarking to identify anomalous behavior patterns in API queries.

### 5. 🔐 Security Hardening & Production Readiness
*   **Live Backend Integration**: The frontend now loads investigations, evidence, dashboard metrics, and AI workspace context from the running backend rather than static mock data.
*   **Security Modules**: MFA, session management, secret handling, SIEM delivery, and compliance scanning modules were added and hardened for integration.
*   **Safer Defaults**: Demo seeding and background tasks are disabled by default unless explicitly enabled for local testing.
*   **Verified Build**: The frontend production build was verified successfully with Vite after the integration changes.
*   **Full Documentation**: See [Phase 1 Enterprise Security Implementation](./PHASE1_SECURITY_IMPLEMENTATION.md) for the complete module reference, API docs, and integration guide.

## 🏢 Agency Coordination Matrix

The portal is pre-configured with operational parameters aligned directly with standard Indian cybersecurity frameworks:

*   **I4C (Indian Cyber Crime Coordination Centre)**: Unified reports mapping national threats, scams, and suspect wallet registries.
*   **CBI & State Cyber Cells**: Court-ready case files with signed forensic hash summaries admissible under Section 65B of the Indian Evidence Act.
*   **NIA (National Investigation Agency)**: Sanctions list enrichment and cross-chain tracking of exfiltrated assets.

---
*Developed for law enforcement agents, compliance supervisors, and digital forensic investigators.*
